Swift Example
===============================


This plugin allows developers to add BitPay payments in their mobile projects.

# Requirements

This plugin requires the following:

* A BitPay merchant account ([Test](http://test.bitpay.com) and [Production](http://www.bitpay.com))
* It is **HIGHLY** recommended to use a custom middleware to relay from your project to BitPay, so tokens can be stored in one location and not individual devices.  A Node version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/bitpay/middleware-node)

# Installation

Copy and paste the code in the `Example.swift` file to your project wherever you want to trigger a payment.
