# Mobile Suite Integrations for BitPay

This repo contains both server-side `(PHP and NodeJS)` and mobile code snippets `(Swift and Android)`.

## Use Cases

The use case for this suite is to add a middleware layer between your custom integration and BitPay.  For example, instead of deploying API keys to mobile devices and having to update if the key is compromised, instead use the middleware and have one central key, and relay the transactions between your application and BitPay

For setup instructions and examples, clone the repo, and use the code exerpts in each folder.
